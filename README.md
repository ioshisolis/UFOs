# UFO´s and JavaScript


# Overview of Project 

The main purpose of this project is about Dana´s UFO sightings website, currently her dynamic webpage only takes one filter. She´d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. To make it more interesting we need to add table filters for the city, state, country and shape. 

# Results

In order to use our new filters, we need to understand how to use our website. As soon as we enter to our new website, we can see the filters on the left, and all unfiltered data on our dynamic table on the right.

Then we can put the first filter for a State.

# Summary 

The website filters are ready, but you must have some knowledge of what king of information we have on our main date in order to know what options you can filter by, it would be good to place a dropdown menu for the filter oprions, also i don´t think the Country filter is necesary since there is only information from the United States.
